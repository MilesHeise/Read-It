# Read-It

A Reddit clone on the Rails framework. Taught myself RSpec testing, Object Relational Mapping
and SQL, and writing authorizations on Rails. Got experience using gems including Figaro and Sendgrid.

## Trying it out

* get the gem dependencies by running `bundle install`

* create and seed a sample database to populate the app using `rake db:create` and `rake db:setup`

* run the app with `rails s` and navigate your browser to `localhost:3000`

* you can sign up your own user if you like, but to save time there are pre-seeded `member@example.com` and `admin@example.com` (both with password "helloworld") to view the page as a standard user or admin.
